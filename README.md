Real Estate Price Prediction :

This project involves predicting real estate prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, year built, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates the price of a house given these features.

The project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of houses to predict their prices. The model is trained using regression techniques to provide an estimated price based on the input features. This project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 21 columns, including:

id: Unique identifier for each house.
date: Date of the house sale.
price: Sale price (target variable).
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.
sqft_living: Square footage of the living space.
sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot.
floors: Number of floors.
waterfront: Whether the house has a waterfront view.
view: Quality of the view from the house.
condition: Condition of the house.
grade: Overall grade given to the house.
sqft_above: Square footage of the house excluding the basement.
sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement.
yr_built: Year the house was built.
yr_renovated: Year the house was renovated.
zipcode: Zip code of the location.
lat: Latitude coordinate.
long: Longitude coordinate.
sqft_living15: Average square footage of living space for the nearest 15 neighbors.
sqft_lot15: Average square footage of the lot for the nearest 15 neighbors.

Installation :
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.6+
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
TensorFlow (if using deep learning models)


Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.) :
Model training
Evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)
Predictions on the test dataset
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the results are visualized to understand the relationship between the predicted and actual prices.

Visualization :

The notebook includes data visualization steps to explore the dataset and the model's predictions. Various plots like scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices are used to understand the data and results better.
